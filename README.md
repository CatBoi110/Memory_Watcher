\\ How this program works // 
The main file that is ran is the Memory_Watcher file, this file will moniter your system's memory usage.
Once the usage exceeds the percentage assigned in the Setup program, Memory_Warning will appear, this will warn the user that they have reached the max amount of memory used for their system.
If the used memory lower than the target, the warning will close, if the used memory is higher it will open. At any time if the user wishes to close the warning they may hit the X button to close it. 
If they wish to close the watcher as well they can hold the F12 key to terminate both programs.
